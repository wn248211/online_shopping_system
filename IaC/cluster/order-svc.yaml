# SFU CMPT 756
#
# k8s yaml to define a Kubernetes service:
#   1 Service - this opens up the logic
#   1 Service Account - this enable access control
#
# This service will need one or more corresponding Deployments to
# provide Endpoints implementing it.
#
# Because we are using Istio, an Istio VirtualService will reside
# between this Service and the Deployments providing its EndPoints.
#
# Notes:
#
# 1. the Service's .spec.ports[0] needs to match the Deployment's
#    .spec.template.spec.containers[0].ports
